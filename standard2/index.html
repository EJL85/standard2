<h1 id="title">Lets Play Logic Problems</h1>
<h3 id="title">with Elliot Jane</h3>

<h2>STEP #1 - Fetched a Logic Puzzle from <a href="http://www.logic-puzzles.org/init.php">Logic Puzzles.org</a> with a grid size of 3x4 - a Moderate difficulty range was used in the settings to attempt to best emulate the sample problems.</h2>

<h2>STEP#2 - Became familiar with the backstory and clues</h2>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/background.gif"></td>
        <td><img src="images/clues.gif"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>STEP #3 - Skimed clues to see if there were any definitivly known facts</h2>

<h3>CLUE #2 - Plainly stated the air cannon fired 180ft</h3>
<img src="images/board1.gif">

<h2>STEP #4 - Assimilated each clue into useful information</h2>

<h3>CLUE #1 - The Trebuchet was 15ft ahead of the hybrid swing and could be at either 180ft, 165ft, or 150ft. However, clue two narrowed the window down to either 165 or 150. Also, the hybrid sling cannot be set at 165ft.</h3>

<img src="images/board2.gif">

<h3>CLUE #3 - Generated an array to track information. This clue, matriculated, gave the follow result:<br> [hybrid, teams, 135 | 150] less than [device, Flying Eyes, distances]</h3>

<h3>CLUE #4 - hybrid = 135ft | Yukon Bolds</h3>

<img src="images/board3.gif">

<h3>CLUE #5 - Mad Mashers and Potato Bros must be next to each other when considering distance. Mad Masher is either at 180ft, 165ft, or 150ft</h3>

<h2>STEP #5 - Reviewed clues</h2>

<h3>CLUE #1 - hybrid distance = 135 + 15 = trebuchet distance = 150. All that remains is the conclusion that water cannon = 165ft</h3>

<img src="images/board4.gif">

<h3>CLUE #2 - No new information has been provided here.</h3>

<h3>CLUE #3 - This updated clue has now provided a significant amount of new conclusions:</h3>

<table style="width:50%">
    <caption><h3>Flying Eyes has to be ahead in distance, and Mad Mashers and Potato Bros need to be next to each other. As only four slots remain the following conclusions can be made:</h3></caption>
    <tr>
        <td>135ft = YB</td>
        <td>150ft = PB</td>
        <td>165ft = MM</td>
        <td>180ft = FE</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>Now apply all the knowledge to our array and the following table is produced:</h3>

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Team</th>
    <th>Distance</th>
    <th>Device</th>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>Flying Eyes</td>
    <td>180</td>
    <td>Air Cannon</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>Mad Mashers</td>
    <td>150</td>
    <td>Trebuchet</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>Protato Bros</td>
    <td>135</td>
    <td>Hybrid Sling</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>Yukon Bolds</td>
    <td>165</td>
    <td>Water Cannon</td>
</tr>
</table>
